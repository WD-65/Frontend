    <!--
      The `<script>` tag is used to embed or link executable code, most commonly JavaScript.
      `defer`: This attribute tells the browser to download the script in parallel with parsing the HTML,
        and to execute it *after* the HTML document has been fully parsed. This is generally
        recommended for external scripts that manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model),
        as it prevents JavaScript from blocking the HTML rendering.
